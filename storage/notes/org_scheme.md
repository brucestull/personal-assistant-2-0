# Organizing Scheme

## **Step 1: Categorize Items**

Divide everything into clear categories:

1. **Papers and Documents**: Guardianship papers, bills, manuals, etc.
2. **Cleaning Tools**: Mops, brooms, dusters, etc.
3. **Extension Cords and Power Strips**: Electrical accessories.
4. **Electronic Components**: Spare parts, cables, adapters, etc.
5. **Miscellaneous**: Anything else that doesn’t fit above.

## **Step 2: Establish a Decluttering Rule**

Use these questions to decide whether to keep or dispose of an item:

1. **Do I need this?** (Is it relevant to my current life or obligations?)
2. **Will I use this in the next 6 months?**
3. **Is it replaceable if I need it later?**
4. **Does it hold significant sentimental value?**

   * If **no**, recycle, donate, or dispose of it.
   * If **yes**, keep it only if you have space.

## **Step 3: Define Storage Zones**

Assign specific locations for each category:

* **Closets**: Use for less-frequently accessed items like spare extension cords, seasonal cleaning tools, and sentimental documents.
* **Shelves**: Store visible and frequently accessed items like cleaning tools and everyday documents.
* **Garage Shelves**: Use for larger or heavy-duty items like extra power strips and bulkier electronic components.
* **Clear Bins**: Group small, similar items like electronic components or small cords into labeled bins for easy identification.

## **Step 4: Create a Logical Flow for Papers**

1. **Actionable Papers**: Place these in an "Active" folder or tray (e.g., bills, forms to fill).
2. **Important Documents**: Use a labeled accordion file or a safe box for long-term storage (e.g., guardianship documents, legal papers).
3. **Reference Materials**: Manuals, warranties, or guides can go into a binder or clear folder, organized by topic.
4. **Shred/Recycle**: Dispose of anything outdated, duplicates, or irrelevant (e.g., old receipts, junk mail).

## **Step 5: Create a Logical Flow for Hard Items**

1. **Extension Cords & Power Strips**:

   * Keep them coiled and secured with Velcro ties.
   * Use a bin labeled "Power Accessories."
2. **Electronic Components**:

   * Group by type (cables, adapters, boards) in separate compartments of a clear bin or organizer.
3. **Cleaning Tools**:

   * Hang brooms/mops in a closet or garage with wall-mounted hooks.
   * Store small cleaning supplies in a labeled bin or caddy.
4. **Sentimental Items**:

   * Limit to one "Memory Box" per category (e.g., personal vs. work-related).

## **Step 6: Maintenance**

1. Schedule 15–30 minutes weekly to declutter and reorganize.
2. Use labels for bins, shelves, and folders to maintain organization.
3. Stick to your "keep or dispose" rules to prevent clutter from returning.
