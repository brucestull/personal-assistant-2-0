# Control User Access to Project Applications

[User Access Management Models](https://chatgpt.com/share/671fcc89-c4f8-8002-8343-492db04ac39e)

Adding boolean attributes to the custom user model, like `can_access_app_1` or `paid_app_1`, is a straightforward approach, but it might not scale well if you anticipate a growing number of applications or complex access conditions. Here's a comparison of both approaches:

### 1. Boolean Attributes in the Custom User Model
   - **Pros**: Simple to implement and easy to query.
   - **Cons**: Hard to scale—if you add or remove applications, you’ll need to update the model each time. It also risks cluttering the user model with many attributes.

### 2. Separate "AppAccess" Model
   - **Design**: Create an `AppAccess` model with fields to link each user to one or more applications. It could look like this:

     ```python
     from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
     from django.db import models

     User = get_user_model()

     class Application(models.Model):
         name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

     class AppAccess(models.Model):
         user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
         application = models.ForeignKey(Application, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
         can_access = models.BooleanField(default=False)
         paid = models.BooleanField(default=False)
     ```

   - **Pros**: Flexible and scalable. You can add, remove, or update applications without modifying the user model.
   - **Cons**: Slightly more complex to implement and query, as it requires joins between tables.

For long-term flexibility, the `AppAccess` model is often more manageable. This way, you can track both free and paid access to multiple applications, add new applications dynamically, and even add conditions based on user profiles or other factors.
