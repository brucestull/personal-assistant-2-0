## Request

I want to make a semi-modern 2-page resume.

I am an aspiring software developer. I have some education experience in software and I have also been a software bootcamp teaching assistant.

Can you provide the necessary parts for this kind of resume?

I'm building a resume maker app using Django and I'm excited to use it to create my actual resume. I'm already familiar with how to use `python-docx`. And I'm an excellent Django developer.

Help me create a stellar resume!

## Response

Creating a standout resume as an aspiring software developer with a mix of education and practical experience requires a strategic approach to content organization and presentation. Your resume should emphasize your technical skills, educational background, practical experience, and personal projects, particularly focusing on your work with Django and your proficiency in using `python-docx` for a resume maker app. Here's how you can structure your semi-modern 2-page resume:

### Page 1: Core Information and Technical Proficiencies

#### Header
- **Name**
- **Contact Information:** Phone number, Email, LinkedIn profile, GitHub link (if applicable)

#### Professional Summary
- A brief 3-4 sentence section that highlights your software development expertise, your experience as a software bootcamp teaching assistant, and your passion for building software with Django. Mention your project of creating a resume maker app.

#### Technical Skills
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript (mention any other languages you're proficient in)
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** Django, React.js (if you know it), Flask (any other relevant ones)
- **Tools & Technologies:** Docker, Git, `python-docx`, PostgreSQL, SQLite
- **Platforms:** Linux, Windows, macOS

#### Education
- **Degree & Field of Study** (e.g., Bachelor of Science in Computer Science)
- **Institution Name**
- **Graduation Date** (or expected graduation date)
- Briefly mention any notable projects, achievements, or coursework relevant to software development.

### Page 2: Experience & Projects

#### Professional Experience
- **Software Bootcamp Teaching Assistant**
  - **Institution Name, Location**
  - **Dates of Employment**
  - A bullet list of responsibilities and accomplishments, such as mentoring students, developing teaching materials, and any specific tools or technologies you focused on.
  
#### Projects Section
This is where you can shine by detailing projects you've worked on, especially those relevant to the job you're aspiring for. Since you're building a resume maker app, that should be prominently featured.

- **Resume Maker App using Django**
  - **Role:** Lead Developer
  - **Technologies Used:** Django, Python-docx, SQLite
  - A brief description of the app, its functionality, and any challenges you overcame during development. Highlight how the app showcases your Django skills and your ability to create practical software solutions.
  
- **Other Projects**
  - If you have other significant projects, especially those that involve different technologies or show off your versatility as a developer, list them here. Each project should include the technologies used and a brief description.

#### Additional Information (Optional)
- **Certifications:** List any relevant certifications here.
- **Languages:** If you speak multiple languages, that can be a plus.
- **Interests:** Briefly list interests that demonstrate your passion for technology, teamwork, and continuous learning.

### Tips for Making Your Resume Stand Out:
- **Quantify Your Achievements:** Whenever possible, use numbers to quantify your achievements and responsibilities, such as the number of students you mentored or the performance improvements of your projects.
- **Tailor Your Resume:** Customize the resume for the job you're applying for, emphasizing the most relevant skills and experiences.
- **Modern Design:** Use a clean, modern design with clear headings and a logical layout. Since you're familiar with `python-docx`, you might leverage its features to create a unique but professional design.

This framework provides a robust starting point for your resume. Adjust each section based on your personal experiences and achievements. Remember, the goal of your resume is not just to list what you've done, but to showcase your potential as a software developer.
