Explain what each part of this `MakeFile` does.

```makefile
.PHONY: clean test coverage covhtml

# Clean pyc and __pycache__
clean:
	find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -r {} +
	find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete
	echo "Cleaned __pycache__ and .pyc files."

# Run pytest only
test:
	pytest --ds=config.settings

# Run pytest with coverage
coverage:
	pytest --ds=config.settings --cov=plan_it --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html

# Open the HTML coverage report (Linux/Mac)
covhtml:
	xdg-open htmlcov/index.html || open htmlcov/index.html || echo "Please open htmlcov/index.html manually."
```

Sure! Here's a breakdown of **each part of the provided `Makefile`**, line by line, with explanations:

---

### 1. `.PHONY` Declaration

```makefile
.PHONY: clean test coverage covhtml
```

* **Purpose:**
  Declares these targets (`clean`, `test`, `coverage`, `covhtml`) as "phony".
* **Meaning:**
  These are not actual files; they are just command labels. This prevents Make from getting confused if a file with the same name exists.

---

### 2. `clean` Target

```makefile
clean:
	find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -r {} +
	find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete
	echo "Cleaned __pycache__ and .pyc files."
```

* **Purpose:**
  Removes Python bytecode and cache files to clean the working directory.
* **Commands Explained:**

  * `find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -r {} +`
    Finds and removes all `__pycache__` directories recursively.
  * `find . -type f -name "*.pyc" -delete`
    Deletes all `.pyc` files.
  * `echo "..."`
    Prints a message confirming the cleanup.

---

### 3. `test` Target

```makefile
test:
	pytest --ds=config.settings
```

* **Purpose:**
  Runs all tests using `pytest`.
* **Command Explained:**

  * `pytest --ds=config.settings`
    Runs `pytest` with Django settings module specified as `config.settings`.

---

### 4. `coverage` Target

```makefile
coverage:
	pytest --ds=config.settings --cov=plan_it --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```

* **Purpose:**
  Runs tests and collects coverage data.
* **Command Explained:**

  * `--cov=plan_it`
    Measures coverage of the `plan_it` module.
  * `--cov-report=term-missing`
    Outputs a report in the terminal showing missing lines.
  * `--cov-report=html`
    Generates an HTML report in `htmlcov/`.

---

### 5. `covhtml` Target

```makefile
covhtml:
	xdg-open htmlcov/index.html || open htmlcov/index.html || echo "Please open htmlcov/index.html manually."
```

* **Purpose:**
  Opens the generated HTML coverage report.
* **Command Explained:**

  * `xdg-open htmlcov/index.html`
    Tries to open the HTML report using the default browser on Linux.
  * `|| open htmlcov/index.html`
    If the above fails, tries MacOS's `open` command.
  * `|| echo ...`
    If both fail, prompts the user to open the file manually.
