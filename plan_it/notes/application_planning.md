# PlanIt! Application Planning

- [Household Management App Design - Private](https://chatgpt.com/c/6826392c-7a7c-8002-9671-5dd02f1e01ce)

I want to make a Django app to manage household storage, inventory, and maintenance of stuff. I have lots of stuff. I'm still trying to organize my thoughts and application design.

I'm thinking of a model `StorageLocation`:

* Bedroom shelf
* Garage shelf 01
* Garage shelf 02
* Bedroom Closet
* Yard Shed
* Hallway Closet
* Workdesk
* Kitchen Table
* Yard
* Patio
* Inside
* Outside
* Away From Home

I'm thinking that I will have locations for storage and locations which have some maintenance task to perform on.

I'm thinking there will be several types of maintenance `MaintenanceType`:

* Mechanical
* Electrical
* Cleaning
* HVAC
* Light Cleaning
* Deep Cleaning

I want to have an `Item` model:

* Socket Set 01
* Socket Set 02
* Socket Set 03
* Tool Box 01
* Tool Box 02
* Shelf 01
* Shelf 02
* Zero Turn Mower
* Lawn Mower
* Yard Blower
* Table 01
* Table 2 ft by 6 ft
* Table 4 ft Round
* Gasoline Can
* Barbecue Grill
* Barbecue Grilling Implements
* Lawn Chairs
* Lawn Chair Type A
* Lawn Chair Type B
* Bicycle
* Bicycle Safety Gear
* Winter Clothes
* Summer Clothes

`MaintenanceType` may inherit from `ActivityType`.

Other activities:

* Personal Hygiene
* Sweep the Kitchen
* Sweep the Livingroom
* Mop the Kitchen
* Mop the Livingroom
* Do Python Homework
* Plan Activities for Mom and I
* Plan My Day
* Invite Friends for a Barbecue

Does this make sense?

For storage:

* I want to track what `Room` and `Shelf` `Item01` is located.

For activities:

* I want to track the `Cleaning` of `Kitchen` location.

It looks like I have `Locations`, `Activities`, `Items`, etc.

Help me brain-storm some more. This app is important for my management of ADHD so I can get important activities completed and find what I need when I need the thing.


Absolutely, this is an excellent and meaningful project, and your design thinking is already off to a great start.
You're basically wanting a **Household Asset & Activity Management System**, combining **inventory management**, **location tracking**, and **activity (maintenance and personal tasks) tracking**.

## 💡 Core Concepts Emerging

Let's zoom out and organize your thoughts into **conceptual domains**:

### 1. **Locations & Storage**

* Can be hierarchical (e.g., House > Room > Shelf)
* Locations may also be functional (Inside, Outside, Away From Home)
* Items can have a **primary location** (where they are stored)
* Locations themselves may need maintenance (cleaning, repair)

### 2. **Items**

* Physical things you own
* Belong in a **location**
* May have **maintenance needs** (oil mower, clean toolbox)
* Can have attributes (serial number, purchase date, photos, etc.)

### 3. **Activities & Maintenance**

* Can be recurring or ad hoc
* Can target a **Location**, an **Item**, or even **Personal Tasks**
* Have types like `Cleaning`, `Mechanical`, `Planning`, etc.
* May inherit from a generic `ActivityType`

### 4. **Activity Context**

* Maintenance on an Item (e.g., oil the lawnmower)
* Maintenance on a Location (e.g., sweep the garage)
* Planning or personal activities (not tied to an item or location)

## 🛠 Suggested Models (Concept Sketch)

### `StorageLocation`

| Field                                             | Example        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| name                                              | Bedroom Shelf  |
| parent\_location (optional FK to StorageLocation) | Bedroom Closet |

> ✅ Hierarchical support using self-referential foreign key
> ✅ Can later visualize as tree if needed

---

| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Find where an item is                | Where is Socket Set 02?         |
| See what tasks are due in a location | What needs cleaning in Kitchen? |
| See what tasks are due on an item    | When did I last oil the mower?  |
| See what activities to plan          | Plan My Day                     |

* Serial Number
* Warranty Expiry
* Purchase Date
* Cost
* Notes / Photos

### ⬜ Location Attributes

* Type (Room, Shelf, Garage, etc.)
* Dimensions
* Notes

### ⬜ Activity Enhancements

* Priority Level (High, Medium, Low)
* Frequency (Daily, Weekly, Yearly)
* Last Completed Date
* Next Due Date (calculated)

### ⬜ Activity Logging

* Log of performed activities (when, by who, notes)

## 💡 Conceptual Relationships Diagram (Textual)

```
StorageLocation (hierarchical)
    └── contains -> Item
        └── has -> Activity (on item)
    └── has -> Activity (on location)

ActivityType
    └── categorizes -> Activity

Personal Activities (Activity without Item or Location)
```

---

## 💡 Next-Level Thoughts

1. **User-friendly Dashboard**

   * Tasks due today
   * Items to find
   * Maintenance due soon

2. **Filtering**

   * View by Room / Area
   * View by Activity Type
   * View by Item needing attention

3. **Search & Quick Find**

   * Search by item name, location, activity

4. **Visualizations**

   * Tree view of storage locations
   * Calendar view of upcoming tasks

If yes, just say "**Yes, Django starter.**"


Yes, Django starter.


Excellent. Here's a clean, ADHD-friendly **Django starter project** for your **Household Storage, Inventory & Maintenance App**.
