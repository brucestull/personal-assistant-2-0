# Logging

- [Logging Configuration for Celery](https://chat.openai.com/share/579d1af6-534b-4b26-8f66-18824f715297)

Explain what this does:

```python
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'celery': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': 'INFO',
            'propagate': True,
        },
    },
}
```

The snippet you've provided is a configuration dictionary for Python's logging system, specifically tailored for a project that uses Celery, a distributed task queue. Here's a breakdown of what each part does:

1. **`LOGGING`**: This is a Python dictionary used to configure the logging behavior for your application.

2. **`'version': 1`**: This key is required and indicates that you are using the new-style dictionary configuration for logging. The version 1 is the only valid value as of now and signifies the configuration format.

3. **`'disable_existing_loggers': False`**: This setting determines whether loggers that have been already configured before this dictionary is processed should be disabled or not. Setting it to `False` means that existing loggers will continue to work alongside the loggers defined in this configuration.

4. **`'handlers'`**: This section is used to define the handlers that will be used to process log messages. Handlers send the log messages to the configured destinations like the console, a file, a web server, etc.

    - **`'console'`**: This is an identifier for a handler.
    - **`'class': 'logging.StreamHandler'`**: Specifies that this handler is a `StreamHandler`, which sends logging output to streams such as `sys.stdout` or `sys.stderr` (in this case, it will default to `sys.stderr`).

5. **`'loggers'`**: This section is used to specify the loggers to configure.

    - **`'celery'`**: This is an identifier for a logger, specifically for the Celery logger in this case.
    - **`'handlers': ['console']`**: This line associates the 'celery' logger with the 'console' handler defined earlier.
    - **`'level': 'INFO'`**: Sets the logging level to `INFO`. This means that all log messages with a severity level of `INFO` or higher (like `WARNING`, `ERROR`, etc.) will be processed by the handlers attached to the 'celery' logger.
    - **`'propagate': True`**: This means that log messages will be passed to the handlers of ancestor loggers, in addition to any handlers attached to this logger. If set to `False`, the log messages are only processed by the handlers of this logger.

This configuration is typically used in a Django project (or similar Python applications) to configure logging according to the specific needs of the application, focusing here on the Celery component for task queue logging.
