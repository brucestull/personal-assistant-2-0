## Request

I have a Django Boosts Application.

Help me write the "Features" part of my `README.md`.

The features are:

- User can create `Inpirational` statements
- User can view thier list of `Inspirational`s
- User has a `Beastie` (a twist on the word "bestie")
- User clicks a button to send their `Inspirational` to their `Beastie`
- Celery provides asynchronous email sending
- `python-redis`
- `CustomUser` model with `registration_accepted` field
- `RegistrationAcceptedMixin` to allow only `registration_accepted` users access to the application's views
- Custom `403` page for useful user authentication and permission status


### Response

Certainly! Below is a draft for the "Features" section of your `README.md` for your Django Boosts Application. This section highlights the key functionalities and technical highlights of your application, making it informative and appealing to potential users or contributors.

## Features

Django Boosts Application offers a unique blend of functionality and technical sophistication designed to inspire and connect users. Here are the highlights of what it brings to the table:

- **Inspirational Statements Creation**: Users can craft and save their own motivational or inspirational statements, personalizing their experience and creating content that resonates with them.

- **Personal Inspirational List**: Each user can view their collection of 'Inspirational' statements, allowing easy access to their custom motivational content whenever they need a boost.

- **Beastie Feature**: Every user gets a 'Beastie' â€“ our playful twist on the concept of a 'bestie' or best friend. This feature adds a layer of engagement and fun to the user experience.

- **Sharing with Beasties**: With just a click of a button, users can share their inspirational statements with their 'Beastie', making motivation and positive vibes spread easily among friends.

- **Asynchronous Email Sending**: Leveraging Celery, the application ensures that emails, such as those sharing Inspirational statements with a Beastie, are sent asynchronously. This enhances the application's performance and user experience by not blocking the main thread during email dispatch.

- **Integration with Python-Redis**: The application utilizes `python-redis` for efficient caching and session storage, significantly improving load times and scalability.

- **Custom User Model**: Features a `CustomUser` model that includes a `registration_accepted` field. This field is crucial for controlling access to the application, ensuring that only approved users can create and share Inspirational statements.

- **RegistrationAcceptedMixin**: This mixin is used to restrict access to the application's views, ensuring that only users with `registration_accepted` status can interact with the core features of the application.

- **Custom 403 Page**: Enhances user experience during authentication and permission issues by providing a custom 403 page. This page offers useful information to users about their authentication status and what actions they can take, making the application more user-friendly and secure.

These features combine to create a user-centered, performance-oriented application that not only motivates and inspires but also does so with an emphasis on user experience and technical excellence.
```

This section succinctly outlines the features of your application, emphasizing both the user experience aspects (like creating and sharing inspirational statements) and the technical advancements (such as asynchronous email sending and the use of `python-redis`). Adjust as necessary to fit the tone and details of the rest of your `README.md`.

## Request

Make a statement for:

```
`utils.get_database_config_variables` function to get database configuration variables from Heroku database URL environment variable
```

... please?

### Response

Certainly! Here's a concise statement you could use to describe the `utils.get_database_config_variables` function:

"The `utils.get_database_config_variables` function is designed to seamlessly extract and return database configuration variables by parsing the Heroku database URL environment variable. This utility ensures that applications can dynamically access database credentials and settings, facilitating secure and efficient database connections in Heroku-hosted environments."
