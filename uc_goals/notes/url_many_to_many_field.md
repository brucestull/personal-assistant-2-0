# Add URL ManyToManyField to Goal model

- [URL model relationship options](https://chatgpt.com/share/67ab180d-ad44-8002-a0a8-62285b6c3a19)

## The Prompt

I want to add multiple URL values to a "CentralStore" model. I'm thinking of making a "URL" model and then using a ForeignKey relationship. Is this a good way, or is there a much greater way to do this?

By the way. If I do it this way, I believe that I could expand the URL model as needed. Like including a special 'name', 'desciption', etc.

## The Response

Yes, creating a separate `URL` model and linking it to the `CentralStore` model using a `ForeignKey` is one approach, but a **better** way in this case would be to use a **ManyToManyField** instead of a **ForeignKey**. Here's why:

### **Why ManyToManyField is Better?**
- A `ForeignKey` creates a **one-to-many** relationship, meaning each `URL` would belong to only one `CentralStore`. This is fine if URLs are strictly unique to one store.
- A `ManyToManyField` allows **multiple stores** to be associated with the same URL, which could be useful in the future (e.g., multiple stores sharing the same resource link).
- If you later need more attributes for `URL` (like `name`, `description`), the Many-to-Many setup keeps the database structure **more flexible**.

### **Implementation with ManyToManyField**
```python
from django.db import models

class URL(models.Model):
    url = models.URLField(unique=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name if self.name else self.url

class CentralStore(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    urls = models.ManyToManyField(URL, related_name="central_stores")

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name
```

---

### **If You Must Use ForeignKey**
If URLs are **only ever linked to one CentralStore**, then your ForeignKey approach is valid:
```python
class URL(models.Model):
    central_store = models.ForeignKey(CentralStore, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name="urls")
    url = models.URLField(unique=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True, null=True)
    description = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.name if self.name else self.url
```
- `related_name="urls"` allows you to access a store's URLs using `store.urls.all()`
- If a store is deleted, `on_delete=models.CASCADE` ensures that all associated URLs are deleted.

### **When to Use What?**
| Use Case | ForeignKey | ManyToManyField |
|----------|-----------|----------------|
| Each URL belongs to only **one** CentralStore | ✅ | ❌ |
| A URL can be shared among **multiple** CentralStores | ❌ | ✅ |
| Need future flexibility? | ❌ | ✅ |

---
### **Conclusion**
If URLs will **only ever belong to one CentralStore**, use `ForeignKey`.  
If URLs might be shared across **multiple** stores or you want flexibility, use `ManyToManyField`.

Do you foresee any need for URL sharing between stores in your case?
